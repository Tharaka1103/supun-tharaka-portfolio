## Overview

In this project, I focused on automating the time-consuming design handover process. The goal was to create a pipeline that transforms Figma designs directly into clean, production-ready code. By integrating design tokens, component libraries, and automated workflows, this solution significantly reduces the time spent translating design assets into code while maintaining design consistency across products.

## Key Features

- **Multi-step Form**: Created an intuitive 3-step registration process that guides users through personal information, account details, and preferences with smooth transitions.
- **Form Validation**: Implemented real-time validation for each input field, providing immediate feedback to users and ensuring data accuracy before submission.
- **Progress Tracking**: Added a visual progress indicator that shows users their current position in the registration flow and allows easy navigation between completed steps.
- **Data Persistence**: Integrated local storage functionality to preserve user input between steps, preventing data loss if the browser is closed accidentally.## Technologies Used

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For structuring the registration form and creating semantic markup.
- **CSS**: For styling the form elements and creating smooth animations between steps.
- **JavaScript**: For handling form validation, step transitions, and user interactions.
- **LocalStorage**: For temporarily storing form data between steps.

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the main challenges was implementing smooth transitions between form steps while maintaining user data. This required careful state management and animation timing. Another challenge was creating responsive layouts that work well across different screen sizes while keeping the form elements properly aligned and accessible.

## Results

The animated registration form project successfully demonstrates modern web development practices and user experience principles. The implementation of real-time validation, smooth animations, and data persistence creates a seamless registration experience. The project serves as a practical example of combining form functionality with engaging user interface design.
